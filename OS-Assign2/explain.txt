Main Parts of the Solution/patteern 👇🏻
_______________________________________
1️⃣ Semaphore
Acts like a traffic light or counter.
Controls how many threads can do something at the same time.
Has two main operations:
waitSem() → “stop/go to sleep if not allowed.”
signalSem() → “allow one waiting thread to continue.”

2️⃣ Mutex (Mutual Exclusion Semaphore)
A special semaphore with value 1.
Makes sure only one thread at a time can touch the shared resource (the queue).

3️⃣ Empty Semaphore
Counts how many spaces are left in the waiting area.
Cars use it:
If it’s 0 → the area is full → car waits.
When a pump finishes → Empty.signalSem() → one car can enter.


4️⃣ Full Semaphore
Counts how many cars are waiting in the queue.
Pumps use it:
If it’s 0 → no cars → pump waits.
When a car enters → Full.signalSem() → wakes a pump.


5️⃣ Queue (Shared Buffer)
Holds the waiting cars.
Shared between all car and pump threads.
Access is protected by the mutex.

6️⃣ Threads
Car threads (Producers): add themselves to the queue.
Pump threads (Consumers): remove cars from the queue and serve them.

What happens in code step by step 👇🏻
______________________________________
1️) A car arrives

When a new Car thread starts, it says:
    “I’m here! Is there an empty spot?”

It checks the Empty semaphore:
If there is space,
     it enters the queue.

If there’s no space, 
    it waits until someone leaves.

Then it locks the queue (Mutex), adds itself, unlocks, and tells pumps:
    “Hey, a car is waiting!” (Full.signalSem())

_____________________________________________________________
2️) A pump is waiting

Each Pump thread is sitting idle, saying:
“I’m waiting for a car…”

It checks the Full semaphore.
    If Full = 0 (no cars waiting), it sleeps.
    Once Full > 0 (a car arrived), it wakes up.

Then it locks the queue (Mutex), removes the first car, unlocks, and tells cars:
“There’s a free space now!” (Empty.signalSem())

Then it “washes” the car (just waits for a few seconds with Thread.sleep()).

_________________________________________________________________
3️) Everything repeats

Cars keep arriving.

Pumps keep serving.

Semaphores make sure no two things happen at once:

Mutex → one person at a time touches the queue.

Empty → cars wait if no spots.

Full → pumps wait if no cars.
